# Feature Requests

This is the holding list for requests that have a clear user need but are not committed roadmap work. Entries stay here until they are accepted into a release plan or explicitly declined.

## Implemented On Main

These features are implemented on `main` and await release verification.

### Export Word (.docx)

**Sources:** [#31](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/31)

**Status:** Exports GFM document structure, common inline formatting, lists, tables, links, code blocks, and standalone local images to `.docx`. HTML and unsupported syntax degrade to text.

### Export shareable images

**Sources:** [#35](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/35)

**Status:** Exports desktop and mobile reading pages as separate PNG files. Longer documents continue as numbered pages, with the final page trimmed to its content.

### Document outline

**Sources:** [#21](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/21), [#27](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/27)

**Status:** Adds a Files / Outline switch in the existing sidebar. Headings navigate in both visual and Markdown source modes.

### Windows startup performance

**Sources:** [#32](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/32)

**Status:** Adds opt-in `COLAMD_STARTUP_TRACE=1` timing from main-process load through editor readiness. Export dependencies are dynamically loaded, reducing the main startup bundle from about 1.73 MB to 604 KB.

### Diagram rendering (Mermaid)

**Sources:** [#26](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/26)

**Status:** Mermaid blocks render through a lazily created hidden iframe, isolated from the main bundle (same-process iframe isolation, not a hardened browser sandbox). Includes 400ms debounce, click-to-edit source mode, and a 15s timeout recovery. The earlier CPU-storm removal (v1.8.1) is addressed by ignoring view-internal DOM mutations in the node view.

### Visible save status hint

**Source:** [#49](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/49)

**Status:** A quiet `未保存 / 已保存` hint sits beside the filename in the title bar. `未保存` shows while edits are pending; `已保存` flashes after autosave or manual save, then fades out. No timestamps, no toasts.

### Heading anchor navigation

**Source:** [#50](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/50)

**Status:** Plain clicks on `[text](#anchor)` links jump to the matching heading with a smooth scroll. Slug resolution follows GitHub rules: lowercase, punctuation stripped, CJK preserved, URL-encoded targets decoded, case-insensitive fallback, and `-1`/`-2` suffixes for repeated headings. External links keep the ⌘/Ctrl+click-to-open behavior; anchor clicks never move the caret.

### Theme menu selected state

**Status:** Theme menu entries are now checkboxes showing the active theme, including imported custom themes. The renderer reports the applied theme to the main process, which rebuilds the menu on change.

### Recent files and restore last session

**Source:** [#28](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/28), [#45](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/45)

**Status:** File → Open Recent lists the last 10 documents (stale paths pruned). Opening or Save-As records the file in `~/.colamd/recent.json`. At launch the app reopens the most recent document by default; a checkbox in the same submenu turns restore off, and Clear Recent wipes the list. The startup restore policy is queued for redesign; the desired default is a blank launch unless the previous session ended unexpectedly or the system restarted.

### Configurable editor font

**Source:** User request (#7752855)

**Status:** View → Editor Font… opens a settings dialog with font family and size plus a live preview. The preference is layered user > theme > defaults, overriding only the editor prose and source mode; code blocks and UI keep their theme fonts. Stored locally, synced across windows.

### Multiple windows

**Source:** [#44](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/44)

**Status:** File → New Window opens an independent editor window; opening a file that is already open focuses its window, and an empty window is reused before spawning a new one. Each window keeps its own file, save queue, watcher, and unsaved-changes guard.

### Startup session restore policy

**Source:** User feedback (2026-08-28)

**Need:** Keep normal launches blank instead of automatically reopening the last document. Reopen documents only when there is a clear recovery context, such as an unexpected app exit or system restart.

**Scope:** Separate the recent-files list from session recovery, define how intentional quit differs from a crash or restart, and keep recovery explicit and predictable. Remove or redesign the current default-on "restore last document" behavior.

**Status:** Deferred. The current restore behavior remains in `v2.0.0`; do not change it in this release.

## Security Maintenance

### Upgrade Electron and transitive security dependencies

**Source:** `npm audit` (2026-08-28)

**Need:** Upgrade the Electron runtime and its transitive dependencies to versions that address the currently reported security advisories, without weakening the app's document and renderer security model.

**Scope:** Evaluate the required Electron major-version upgrade, then verify macOS code signing and notarization, Windows and Linux builds, auto-update manifests, Mermaid rendering, file opening, IPC boundaries, and unsaved-document protection on every supported platform.

**Status:** Planned. Do not mix this with issue #55, whose reported PostCSS version is outdated and is not present in the current dependency tree.

## Candidates

### Markdown formatting shortcuts

**Source:** [#58](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/58)

**Need:** Provide discoverable shortcuts for common Markdown formatting such as bold, italic, links, lists, strikethrough, and inline code.

**Scope:** First evaluate the common commands and conflicts with editor/browser shortcuts. Keep shortcut customization and disable controls out of the initial implementation; they require a broader preferences/keybinding system.

**Status:** Candidate.

### Import local images

**Source:** [#21](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/21)

**Need:** Insert local images into Markdown without compromising editor stability or document content.

**Status:** Deferred. The initial menu, paste, and drag-and-drop implementation was removed before `v1.9.0` after it proved unreliable.

**Status:** Planned for next week's development review.

### Publish ColaMD for iOS

**Source:** User request

**Need:** Publish the iOS app under the unified `ColaMD` product name so anyone can install it from the App Store.

**Scope:** Publish the main ColaMD app first: create the App Store Connect record, configure Release distribution signing, upload an archive, run internal and external TestFlight verification, prepare screenshots and store metadata, complete privacy and export-compliance declarations, submit App Review, and verify public installation plus `.md` / `.txt` opening after release. Defer the Share Extension until it has a clear user need; it is an optional later update, not a prerequisite for the first release.

**Signing note:** Development signing is only for registered test devices. App Store distribution signing is a separate profile that Xcode can create and manage automatically from the company Apple Developer Program account. No manual profile editing is planned.

**Status:** Deferred. First release scope is the main app only; Share Extension remains optional.

### Merge Windows menu bar into title bar

**Source:** [#46](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/46)

**Need:** On Windows, put menu items on the same row as the document title and window controls (like VS Code), reclaiming one row of vertical space.

**Why it fits:** Reduces top chrome on Windows where the separate native menu bar wastes height.

**Constraints:** Keep native minimize/maximize/close behavior, keyboard access to menus, existing shortcuts, and window dragging. Only affects Windows; macOS already integrates menus natively.

### Footnote hover preview

**Source:** [#25](https://github.com/marswaveai/ColaMD/issues/25)

**Need:** Hover a footnote reference to preview its definition in place, instead of jumping to the document bottom.

**Why it fits:** Standard GFM footnotes (`[^1]` / `[^1]:`) are already parsed. A hover preview improves navigation without adding new UI.

**Constraints:** Build on the existing footnote rendering with a lightweight hover interaction. Do not add a permanent panel.

## Declined

### Built-in translation

Translation introduces provider, configuration, privacy, and product-scope complexity outside ColaMD's focused Markdown editing role.

### Tabs and persistent multi-document workspace

ColaMD deliberately avoids workspace and tab-system complexity. Existing file opening and lightweight directory browsing remain the primary document navigation model.

### Resizable file panel

The file panel remains a fixed 220px lightweight list. Long names reveal themselves through hover scrolling, avoiding a persisted layout state and drag affordance.
